Slack twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, 'X' vs 'O', taken in turns, first to 3 wins.

| Created using native JavaScript, CSS & HTML. Started with adding the X's and O's on the game board, then how to switch players, also a lot of time was spent on checking the Win/Draw condition and outputting it correctly and finally the board reset method. |
| :------------------------------------:|
| Switches turns between two players. |
| Displays which player won or if it's a draw. |
| Highlights the winning tiles.  |
| Ability to reset the board after or during a game.|
| To be added custom player names & player scores |
